## Design Decisions

### Why Next.js 14?

- **App Router**: Modern React patterns with server components
- **SEO-friendly**: Built-in metadata API
- **Performance**: Automatic optimization and code splitting
- **Deployment**: Seamless Vercel integration
- **Full-stack**: API routes for future backend integration

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- **Rapid prototyping**: Utility-first approach
- **Consistency**: Design system with custom colors
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first by default
- **Dark mode**: Built-in media query support
- **Performance**: Purges unused CSS in production

### Component Architecture

- **Modular**: Each section is a separate component
- **Reusable**: Components can be used in other pages
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Testable**: Pure functional components

## Marketing Copy Highlights

### Hero Value Prop

"Deterministic, repeatable code analysis with AI-powered insights. Analyze your codebase, score issues by difficulty and value, and receive a phased improvement plan—all in seconds."

### Key Differentiators

1. **Deterministic & Auditable**: Same commit + config = same results
2. **AI-Optional**: Works great without AI, even better with it
3. **Config-Driven Scoring**: Two-dimensional scoring (Difficulty + Value)
4. **Phased Plans**: 5 phases from Hygiene to Polish
5. **Delta-Optimized**: Analyze only what changed

### Feature Benefits

- **For Developers**: Faster code reviews, actionable insights, learn best practices
- **For Teams**: Consistent quality, prioritized improvements, reduced technical debt
- **For Organizations**: Security compliance, audit trails, cost-effective scaling
